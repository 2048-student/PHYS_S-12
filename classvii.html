      <div class="section">
        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page details what I learned with class 7, held on 14 July, 2020. This class focused a lot on sensors and other electronic input devices. These would come in handy with controlling inputs and outputs, which is something quite useful when it comes to designing the final project (especially in my case).
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>the components</h2>
          <p>
            To understand the inputs and how they work, we need to first revisit the kit, and then understand applications of these devices and how they can be incorporated into circuits to yield results and outputs with those circuits.
          </p>

            <h3>revisiting the kit</h3>
            <p>
              To understand what electrical input devices are and how they work, we need to look back on the kit we got, and specifically some of the components in it. We looked specifically at anything in bag 2, titled "sensors".
            </p>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>light input</h4>
              <p>
                One very common form of inputs are those that deal with light, otherwise known as light sensors. There are visible light sensors, IR sensors, UV sensors, etc, though our kit really only has visible and IR sensors.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>sound input</h4>
              <p>
                Sound inputs are also really useful when it comes to various projects and components, and typically comes in the form of a microphone. Sensors that measure sound input can also be found in the kit, and can be used to make clap-on and clap-off lights, for example. "Hey Siri" is activated through sound input in the microphone of an iPhone.
              </p>

            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>motion and force</h4>
              <p>
                Another very useful thing that can be measured and used as input is motion, or by extension, pressure. The kit contains a proximity sensor, as well as Velostat pressure-sensitive sheets. These can measure changes in pressure or distance, which can be used to make automatically-opening doors, for example. The kit also contains an accelerometer, which measures difference in velocity and motion, which is commonly used in smartphones for health applications.
