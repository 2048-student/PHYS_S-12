        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page details what I learned with class 5, held on 7 July, 2020. After a quick introduction to arduino and how to code circuits to give us outputs, we started getting a slightly better feel for arduino and a few of the more complicated structures.

        <h2>more programming in arduino</h2>
          <p>
            During this class, we reviewed the basic info that we had learned in the previous class, but we also delved a little more deeply into simplifying code and making it much more efficient, through both conditionals and loops.
          </p>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>conditionals</h3>
            <p>
              In any programming language, conditionals are used to force an output using some sort of given input. In other words, it executes some block of code if some sort of conditional is satisfied. These are done through the <code>if()</code> conditional, where if whatever is inside the statement is <code>true</code>, then whatever is in the brackets is executed. As an example, <code>if(condition){execution}</code> will execute <code>execution</code> if <code>condition</code> holds true, and won't otherwise. You can add in <code>else()</code> afterward for it to execute something else (rather than nothing) should the condition not hold true, but this isn't necessary.
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>loops</h3>
            <p>
              Loops are a fantastic way of continually executing code either for a given duration of time, given number of iterations, or while some sort of conditional holds true. The two most common types of loops that we will be using to code in Arduino are <code>while()</code> loops and <code>for()</code> loops.
            </p>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4><code>while()</code> loop structure</h4>
              <p>
                <code>while()</code> loops, as stated previously, executes a block of code while a given condition holds true, and will exit the loop as soon as the condition no longer holds. The basic structure is <code>while(condition){execution}</code>, and this will stop executing <code>execution</code> as soon as <code>condition</code> no longer holds true.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4><code>for()</code> loop structure</h4>
              <p>
                <code>for()</code> loops are structured a bit differently than <code>while()</code> loops, but have basically the same purpose: execute a block of code while a condition holds true. The structure is a bit different, however: <code>for(int var = initial value; i < final value; i++){execution}</code>. This is the traditional format of the loop, though it may vary. It essentially executes a command for a given number of iterations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p>
              With the basics sorted out here, we were now ready to employ these conditionals and these loops to simplify code and write more complex code in Arduino to do all sorts of funky things with our boards!
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>
            There are of course a variety of other things that we went over, such as "shorthand" operations (such as compound operators), but these were not necessary to employ in our code, as the main purpose of those exercises was to demonstrate how to use conditionals to execute one thing given one condition, and another given another. It also was meant to show how to execute the same chunk of code for some given amount of time/iterations, which would come in real handy (especially for my final project).

        <h2>breakout rooms 1: counting button pushes</h2>
        <p>
          In the first breakout room session, we focused on applying what we learned to count the number of button pushes. The way to do this is quite simple: since we can check button state, all we need to do is check the button state and compare it to the very previous button state. In other words, we start off with the state as <code>OFF</code> for example, and then whenever the button is pushed, we change the state to either <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>, depending on what the current state of the button is. Then, as soon as the state is changed, increment an integer variable <code>button_pushes</code> by 1. This way, every time the state changes, we know the button has been pushed, and so we increment. Here is an example of that in action.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <pre>
              const int button = 3; // button pin
              int state = 0; // this will measure the current state of the button
              int prev = 0; // this will measure the previous state of the button
              void setup(){pinMode (button, INPUT)} // will read the button as an input
              void loop(){
                state = digitalRead(button); // read the current state of the pin
                if(state != prev){
                  // if the current state and the previous state don't match up, increment
                  if(state == HIGH) pushes++
                }
                prev = state;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>With that done, I was now able to measure changes to the button state, and produce some sort of output. </p>
