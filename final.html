        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Here, I document my progress with my final project, from proposal ideas to final execution and presentation. Follow along on my journey through the course, and how I use the knowledge I gain in the course and apply it to my final project.

        <h2>proposal(s)</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the course (and even through to around week 3), I was juggling a few proposals. I wanted a balance between ambition, practicality, and usefuleness. In other words, I wanted to create something that would actually be useful and practical, while also create something I am proud of and find interesting, all while not going completely insane trying to actually execute the idea.

          <h3>proposal 1 -- cars</h3>
          <p>
            My first proposal stemmed from an issue that I personally find myself in (well sort of), and one that I believe a lot of people also suffer from: being able to tell whether or not you will be able to fit your car into a given parking space. I see my dad constantly wasting a lot of time looking behind him to try to see if he could fit our car into a parking space. Sometimes, he decides he can't, and we drive off, many minutes wasted for potentially no reason. So I thought to myself: what if he didn't need to do that himself. And so, my first proposal was born: a device with a camera and sensor that you can plant on the back of the car that would be able to, given the car's dimensions and distance from a given parking space, whether or not your car could fit into the parking space in question. I quickly scrapped that idea, however, as I did not feel that it would be practical to build and code such a contraption to reliably (and consistently) work in 7 weeks at my skill level.

          <h3>proposal 2 -- lamps</h3>
          <p>
            This next proposal involved something a little bit simpler: lamps. I really liked Harry Potter as a kid, and I had visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando a few years back. Butterbeer may have been the tastiest part of the trip, but the wands that could be used to control various lights and aspects of the park were certainly the coolest. So, I thought: why not do the same with the lights in a house? And so, my next proposal was to wire a circuit that could communicate with the lights in a house, and with various gestures of a wand with a signal sender, receive that signal and perform a variety of tasks, such as turning the lights on or off, toggling the brightness, and even the color.

          <h3>proposal 2.5 -- useless box</h3>
          <p>
            This wasn't really a "new" proposal to replace the previous one, as I was tossing around a few ideas at once. I really like the idea of "useless boxes", ie boxes where, if you push a button or flip a switch, a little hand or figurine will pop out of the box to do nothing but push the button again or flip the switch back to neutral position. Many have made these types of boxes, and some have even created skits with these boxes, where they coded the box's reaction to "evolve" the more times the button was pressed or the switch was flipped. This is where I came up with another proposal as a slight modification to the useless box: a useless box with facial expressions (made from LEDs) that evolve to a more angry state the more the button/switch is pushed/flipped, as the box gets progressively more "annoyed" at the individual.

        <p>
          I would spend a considerable amount of time trying to decide between the last two proposals, as I was flip-flopping back and forth for a variety of reasons. I was focusing on practicality, range of possibility, and my own ability to create them to a reasonable extent in 5-7 weeks.
