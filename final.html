          Here, I document my progress with my final project, from proposal ideas to final execution and presentation. Follow along on my journey through the course, and how I use the knowledge I gain in the course and apply it to my final project.

        <h2>proposal(s)</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the course (and even through to around week 3), I was juggling a few proposals. I wanted a balance between ambition, practicality, and usefuleness. In other words, I wanted to create something that would actually be useful and practical, while also create something I am proud of and find interesting, all while not going completely insane trying to actually execute the idea.
        </p>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>proposal 1</h3>
          <p>
            My first proposal stemmed from an issue that I personally find myself in (well sort of), and one that I believe a lot of people also suffer from: being able to tell whether or not you will be able to fit your car into a given parking space. I see my dad constantly wasting a lot of time looking behind him to try to see if he could fit our car into a parking space. Sometimes, he decides he can't, and we drive off, many minutes wasted for potentially no reason. So I thought to myself: what if he didn't need to do that himself. And so, my first proposal was born: <p class="underlined">a device with a camera and sensor that you can plant on the back of the car that would be able to, given the car's dimensions and distance from a given parking space, whether or not your car could fit into the parking space in question</p>. I quickly scrapped that idea, however, as I did not feel that it would be practical to build and code such a contraption to reliably (and consistently) work in 7 weeks at my skill level.

        <h2>why did i join this course?</h2>
        <p>
          As said before, I have a serious passion for physics, both practical and theoretical. I've been fairly decently exposed to the world of theoretical physics and how physics describes the way things work, so actually seeing practical physics at work (and manipulating it) was something that interested me. Being able to model, design, program, and build a contraption that does something interesting is near-invention for me, and makes me feel like quite the engineer/inventor. If not because I really want to make something, simply learning how to be able to do that is quite interesting.
