        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page details what I learned with class 1, held on 23 June, 2020. I enrolled in the Harvard Summer S—Åhool Introduction to Digital Fabrication course, otherwise known as PHYS S-12. There are similar courses, such as PHYS S-70, that are held during the academic year at Harvard Extension School, but I specifically took PHYS S-12 in summer 2020.

        <h2>course information</h2>
          <p>
            This course is a brief introduction to digital fabrication. In other words, this course will teach how to design, code, and build simple machines to execute simple things. As an example, it will help teach to build self-operating lamps or page-turning robots. In other words, this course will teach how to implement practical physics.

            <h3>course structure</h3>
            <p>
              This course will consist of two classes a week, along with two lab sessions on alternating days. It is required to attend both of those, as they count toward participation and actually learning material. There is other reading material that can be found online, and is posted to the website page.
            </p>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>course instructors</h4>
              <p>
                This course is taught by Nathan Melenbrink and Robert Hart. Both work at Harvard University, one as a member of the Wyss Institute, and another as a professor of physics. The course also has a "TA" of sorts, Victoria Shen. All are extremely helpful with course information and with teaching (and assistance).

              <h4>course websites</h4>
              <p>
                The main website for this course is <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/index.html">Nathan's GitHub page</a>.

              <hr>
              <p>
                Another useful website for technical issues, especially with programming and structuring, is <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/">Rob's GitHub page</a>.
              </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>Some info may be posted to the Canvas website, such as the grades and the Zoom links for the meetings, but otherwise, the GitHub pages are the most widely used. </p>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>classes</h4>
            <p>
              Classes will run each Tuesday and Thursday from 23 June up until 8 August, 2020, from 15:15 to 18:15 EDT. Each class has its agenda posted on the respective GitHub page, along with any materials that are necessary.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Everything I learned in any of the classes will be under the repsective class tab on the top, along with what I accomplished at home and in labs.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>labs</h4>
            <p>
              Labs will run on Mondays and Wednesdays, with 13:00-15:00 and 17:00-19:00 sections on Mondays, and 10:00-12:00 and 17:00-19:00 sections on Wednesdays. You must choose one from each day, though you are not required to stay for the entire duration of the section.

            <h4>assignments</h4>
            <p>
              Again, assignments will be posted on the GitHub pages under the class tab, and will detail what should be done (or at least attempted) by the next class session. While it is important to try to complete the assignment in its entirety by the specified deadline, the documentation of your learning and process is what is being actively graded.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
              All of my documentation for my assignments can be found under any of the assignment tabs on the top. It will be under the corresponding number for the respective assignment.

          <h3>final project</h3>
          <p>
            This course, and everything you learn in it, will culminate in the final project, which will be an exercise in design, programming, and execution. Once again, all progress and results should be documented on your personal webpage, and the presentations will take place on 8 August, 2020, the official end of the course.
          </p>

          All of this information, along with more in-depth explanations, can be found in the Syllabus located on the Canvas page (or the official S-12 GitHub page).

      <div class="section">
        <h2>documentation</h2>
        <p>
          As previously stated, the bulk of the grade (60%) will assess one's documentation of their learning on their personal GitHub page. One must thoroughly document what they did in class, what they learned, what they did outside of class, and their progress in assignments, projects, labs, etc. This website is my thorough documentation of everything that I learned in this course. As a benchmark, it should be easily understandable and digestible, to the point that anyone reading it can replicate any projects I detailed.

      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>assignment</h2>
        <p>
          The first assignment has been to create this website and write up a proposal for the final project. I learned a lot about the essence of this course in the first session, and I have already started thinking up ideas for the final project (which can be found in the Final Project tab on top).
