        <h3>Proposal (MODIFIED)</h3>
        <p>Have you ever wanted to operate your lights without needing to flick the switch? Have you ever visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and saw the wands that could operate the different tools and activities? Then my proposal is a fantastic addition to the home! I propose to install sensors near various locations in the house, and then with the flick of a wand, turn on the lights, dim them, etc.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Binder, and I am a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School in good old New York City! I have been very interested in physics for many years, and I think learning how to construct models for inventions I think of is a fantastic way to get an even better grasp of physics! Pursuing a course in digital fabrication would help me better understand modeling and designing small inventions that can help move the world in little ways.</p>

        <h3>Assignment 2: Working with Fusion360 </h3>
        <p>I worked with Fusion360 this past week. It is very similar to AutoCad, which is great in my case, as I already have some practice with AutoCad through my drafting class in school. I worked through the first tutorial, which just showed me how all of the basic tools worked, and I got the hang of it fairly quickly afterward. I also was able to practice on a few simple designs, though I waited mostly for the kit to arrive to model some of the tools.</p>
        <p> Adjusting to using Fusion360 instead of AutoCad has been more or less smooth, though I have been running in a few problems getting the images to work as well, and I am attempting to catch up as best as I can with those materials!</p>

        <h3>Assignment 3: Working with Circuits</h3>
        <p>I have been trying to get everything working, but stuff has certainly not been cooperating with me. Arduino does not want to set up properly, but I do have some ideas on what I want to code my circuit to do. I will keep attempting to get everything to work, and hopefully I can troubleshoot it properly in the coming days!</p>
