    <h3> Proposal </h3>
    <p> I propose a device that, when given your car's size, can calculate whether or not your car can fit into a parking space you point a camera at. This'll save time and energy! It doesn't have to be big, but it should have a camera, light source, and a speaker. The camera should be aimed at the desired parking space, and the light will indicate whether or not it is ready to take a measurement, and a red light coupled with a loud beep will indicate that you will not fit in a parking spot.</p>
    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> Hi! My name is Andrew Binder, and I am a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School in good old New York City! I have been very interested in physics for many years, and I think learning how to construct models for inventions I think of is a fantastic way to get an even better grasp of physics!</p>
