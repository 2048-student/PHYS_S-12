        <p>
          Hi! I'm Andrew Binder, and this is my Digital Fabrication Documentation Page! I'm very excited to partake in this course, and am excited to also tell you about myself. With the menu on the top, you can cycle between my final project, this page, and all of the other classes I attended throughout the course, and each will provide thorough documentation of what I did, what I learned, and will provide pictures and videos of contraptions I have devised, along with the code I inputted into Arduino, when necessary. Now, a little bit about me.

        <p>
          As I've said before, my name is Andrew Binder. As of July 2020, I am a (nearly) 17-year-old, Jewish/Ukrainian-American, rising senior at Stuyvesant High School. I was born in Bensonherst, Brooklyn in 2003, and have since then moved to Washington Heights and the Riverdale, where I live to this day. I have had a huge passion for mathematics and physics for a long time, and was able to pursue that passion through many extracurricular activities, including courses from the Harvard Extension School. Other than math and physics, I have been playing the piano for many years, participate in theatrical productions with the Riverdale Rising Stars community theatre program, and am a second-degree black belt at Riverdale Kenshikai Karate. Being well-rounded has been very important to me and my parents, and so these courses are also a way to broaden my horizons. My first language is Russian, but English is still native for me, given how long I have been speaking it. My parents moved from Ukraine (previously USSR) a few weeks before I was born, and so carrying on that culture is also important to me.

        <h2>why did i join this course?</h2>
        <p>
          As said before, I have a serious passion for physics, both practical and theoretical. I've been fairly decently exposed to the world of theoretical physics and how physics describes the way things work, so actually seeing practical physics at work (and manipulating it) was something that interested me. Being able to model, design, program, and build a contraption that does something interesting is near-invention for me, and makes me feel like quite the engineer/inventor. If not because I really want to make something, simply learning how to be able to do that is quite interesting.
