          Hi! I'm Andrew Binder, and this is my Digital Fabrication Documentation Page! I'm very excited to partake in this course, and am excited to also tell you about myself. With the menu on the top, you can cycle between my final project, this page, and all of the other classes I attended throughout the course, and each will provide thorough documentation of what I did, what I learned, and will provide pictures and videos of contraptions I have devised, along with the code I inputted into Arduino, when necessary. Now, a little bit about me.

        <p>
          As I've said before, my name is Andrew Binder. As of July 2020, I am a (nearly) 17-year-old rising senior at Stuyvesant High School. I was born in Bensonherst, Brooklyn in 2003, and have since then moved to Washington Heights and the Riverdale, where I live to this day. I have had a huge passion for mathematics and physics for a long time, and was able to pursue that passion through many extracurricular activities, including courses from the Harvard Extension School.
