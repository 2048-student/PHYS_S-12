            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> Hello! I am Andrew Binder, and this is my online curriculum vitae. </p>
            <p>
                The navigation bar will link to certain specifics about what I have accomplished thus far. You can contact me with the info below.

                As a note, this website was coded entirely by me, with a little bit of help here and there with embellishment from my father and grandfather. None of the HTML, PHP, CSS, or JS here has been made with any 3rd-party software. I coded it to get a better understanding for web development while completing my CSCI E-12 course, and I have managed to learn a lot!
            </p>
            <p>Now, a quick note about myself!</p>
            <p>
                I was born in Bensonherst, Brooklyn on the 26th of July, 2003. I am a first generation Jewish/Ukrainian immigrant, and was born a few weeks after my parents moved from Odessa. My native language is Russian, but I quickly picked up English as a second native language as soon as I went to elementary school. I am currently native in Russian and English, and fluent in Spanish thanks to my schools' efforts. I went to PS24 from kindergarten to 4th grade, after which I went to the Speyer Legacy School from 6th grade to 8th grade, and now I have just finished up my junior year at Stuyvesant High School.

                This brings us to the present and wraps up the TL;DR about myself! Feel free to explore the rest of my curriculum vitae as well as learn more in-depth info about me by using the navigation bar to the left!
