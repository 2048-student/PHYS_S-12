        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Here, I document my progress with my final project, from proposal ideas to final execution and presentation. Follow along on my journey through the course, and how I use the knowledge I gain in the course and apply it to my final project.

        <h2>proposal(s)</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the course (and even through to around week 3), I was juggling a few proposals. I wanted a balance between ambition, practicality, and usefuleness. In other words, I wanted to create something that would actually be useful and practical, while also create something I am proud of and find interesting, all while not going completely insane trying to actually execute the idea.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>proposal 1 -- cars</h3>
          <p>
            My first proposal stemmed from an issue that I personally find myself in (well sort of), and one that I believe a lot of people also suffer from: being able to tell whether or not you will be able to fit your car into a given parking space. I see my dad constantly wasting a lot of time looking behind him to try to see if he could fit our car into a parking space. Sometimes, he decides he can't, and we drive off, many minutes wasted for potentially no reason. So I thought to myself: what if he didn't need to do that himself. And so, my first proposal was born: a device with a camera and sensor that you can plant on the back of the car that would be able to, given the car's dimensions and distance from a given parking space, whether or not your car could fit into the parking space in question. I quickly scrapped that idea, however, as I did not feel that it would be practical to build and code such a contraption to reliably (and consistently) work in 7 weeks at my skill level.
          </p>

        <hr>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>proposal 2 -- lamps</h3>
          <p>
            This next proposal involved something a little bit simpler: lamps. I really liked Harry Potter as a kid, and I had visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando a few years back. Butterbeer may have been the tastiest part of the trip, but the wands that could be used to control various lights and aspects of the park were certainly the coolest. So, I thought: why not do the same with the lights in a house? And so, my next proposal was to wire a circuit that could communicate with the lights in a house, and with various gestures of a wand with a signal sender, receive that signal and perform a variety of tasks, such as turning the lights on or off, toggling the brightness, and even the color.

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>proposal 2.5 -- useless box</h3>
          <p>
            This wasn't really a "new" proposal to replace the previous one, as I was tossing around a few ideas at once. I really like the idea of "useless boxes", ie boxes where, if you push a button or flip a switch, a little hand or figurine will pop out of the box to do nothing but push the button again or flip the switch back to neutral position. Many have made these types of boxes, and some have even created skits with these boxes, where they coded the box's reaction to "evolve" the more times the button was pressed or the switch was flipped. This is where I came up with another proposal as a slight modification to the useless box: a useless box with facial expressions (made from LEDs) that evolve to a more angry state the more the button/switch is pushed/flipped, as the box gets progressively more "annoyed" at the individual.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>
          I would spend a considerable amount of time trying to decide between the last two proposals, as I was flip-flopping back and forth for a variety of reasons. I was focusing on practicality, range of possibility, and my own ability to create them to a reasonable extent in 5-7 weeks.

          <h3>finalizing the proposal</h3>
          <p>
            After sitting on it for a few weeks, I finally decided between the two proposals I was working with, though I did add in a slight modification to it.
          </p>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>the final proposal</h4>
            <p>
              My final proposal for the final project was the lamp idea, where I would wire a few boards to receive signals sent by (or reflected by) a wand, which would correspond to a precoded command. Instead of one phototransistor or sensor being able to tell apart gesures, I decided to simply wire 4 different phototransistors, each responsible for something different and being able to tell one gesture: two would be for turning the lights on and off (respectively), and the other two for toggling the brightness (increasing and decreasing, respectively). This final proposal was finalized on Monday, 19 July, 2020, after an extensive discussion with Nathan during the 17:00 lab section on 13 July, and some personal thought/consultation afterward. This was to avoid using different gestures.
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>
            After also consulting my mom following the lab, I also considered potentially including an option to toggle speakers to play music, though this is still only a theory, and I will only implement it if time permits.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>
          With the proposal finally set, I was ready to start thinking about how to actually implement this project, and also ready to start drawing up some basic plans for the code and (simplistic) hardware.

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>sudden developments: a last-minute modification</h3>
          <p>
            While working through the class 10 assignment, I was struck with a new idea for a final project, one that was so mesmerizing that I decided to completely scrap my original final project idea in favor of this new one. I decided to work instead with wirebending. After a lot of consideration, I finally decided to scrap the initial proposal in favor of a complete rework of my final project.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>the (true) final proposal</h4>
            <p>
              This completely overhauled final proposal involves creating a 3D wirebending mechanism which can move in multiple dimensions. I would be able to control this mechanism from my computer and through a remote network, and if I give it specific commands and parameters, it would be able to bend copper wire into any configuration I tell it to bend into. I could potentially have a few precoded designs and shapes that I could use to demonstrate the results of this mechanism during the presentation. This modification and new proposal was drafted and finalized on the morning of 28 July, after a lot of contemplation during class 10's assignment.
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>
            This modification to the proposal came, again, as a result of class 10's assignment that I was working on, which involved a 2D wirebending mechanism. More information and thorough documentation can be found in the class 10 tab above. This was also approved by each of the instructors, and they liked this new proposal, and found the video demonstration I linked on my page of an example 3D wirebender "very mesmerizing". While such a last-minute change did sound very troublesome, I found that as long as I built off the results of the class 10 assignment, I would rather easily be able to abstract to a 3rd dimension of motion.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>

          Now, with the proposal finalized (for real this time), I was ready to start working on this new final project (and subsequently scrapping the initial project which I had already started working on).

        <h2>planning out the (eventually scrapped) lamp proposal</h2>
        <p>
          Here, I detail some of my basic plans, and the progression of the plans into something that I can implement. I went through several drafts of plans, each getting more and more detailed, and each one detailing specifics. Eventually, with the final plan, I am ready to implement the plans into a real project.
        </p>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>the initial plans</h3>
          <p>
            Here, I post my initial and rather general plans for the entire project. They each get slightly more detailed, but are still fairly general.
          </p>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>draft 1</h4>
            <p>
              This was the very first plan I drafted after the proposal was finalized. It contains rudementary explanations of what I planned on doing with the project, and how it would work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plan is simple: Have an IR LED send a signal that would be reflected by a wand into one of 4 phototransistors, each responsible for one action (turning on the lights, turning them off, increasing the brightness, and decreasing the brightness). These would send a signal to the lamp(s), making them do what you'd like. It also lists what I need, and what I've acquired already. Finally, I included a crude basic design for a possible case for the mechanism (for prettying purposes), and the functions I'd need to define. I would make edits later, after some discussion with Nathan and Victoria on how to make only some of the lamps perform certain tasks.

              This was the first plan, and the second one gets a little more detailed and more specific. I add on to the proposal after discussion during the breakout rooms, but here was the rough first draft. It included a very basic plan.

            <h3>completely scrapping this idea</h3>
            <p>
              As I listed in the above section on proposals, I eventually, with class 10's work, proceeded to completely scrap this plan in favor of the 3D wirebending proposal. So, even though I had a lot of plans for the creation and execution of this project, I liked the other one much more, and felt that I was much more ready to create that one with the progress on the 2D mechanism already.
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Even though these plans were great and I had a lot of ideas about this project, I felt that scrapping it for the new proposal was ultimately the right decision, as it is something that I would be prouder of and something that I would be able to use more for fun and something that would be quite fun to play with.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Despite the fact that I had scrapped an idea that I spent a lot of hours thinking about and planning, I deemed this ultimately for the best, and I was eager to get started with this new final project idea. While it would be daunting and require more time and thought and planning, I was excited to get started with it and work through it.

          It was now time to plan out this new proposal before executing it. I would need to plan this extensively to simplify the work process later on during the project. This entire section will detail thoroughly all of the planning that went into this proposal.

          <h3>class 10's assignment: 2d wirebender</h3>
          <p>
            To start out, I needed to get the 2D wirebending mechanism to work. This entire final project proposal was inspired by my class 10 assignment, which involved developing a 2D wirebending mechanism with 2 stepper motors and a few 3D printed parts. As soon as I knew I could get this mechanism to work, I knew 'upgrading' to 3 dimensions would not involve that much extra work.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>the wirefeeding mechanism</h4>
            <p>
              The first step was figuring out how the wirefeeding mechanism worked. I would have to feed a wire in  a straight line and at a constant rate into the wirebending part in order for the wire to even be able to bend at all. More thorough documenation of the planning (and eventual execution) of this step can be found on the class 10 tab above, under the subsection under the same name found in the assignment section at the bottom of the page.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <div class="subsubsubsection">
              <h5>the results</h5>
              <p>
                Here are the results I produced for this mechanism. The same results can be found in the class 10 assignment section, but I linked the results here as well. This now smoothly feeds wire through the mechanism to the wirebender, keeping it taut and preventing slipping, allowing for smooth feeding. This would come in handy for the actual final project, as it is a vital part of any automated wirebending mechanism.
              </p>

              <div clas="image"></div>
              <div class="video"></div>
              <hr>
              <p>
                I was now ready to move on to the next part of the build. As always, more thorough documentation can be found in the class 10 page, as this is directly following my class 10 assignment.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Even though this was used to feed wire into a 2D wirebending system, the mechanism would work the exact way for 3D system, thus no further edits or changes were required for this mechanism. Thus, a good chunk of the final project is already complete.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>the wirebending mechanism</h4>
            <p>
              The second step was designing the actual wirebending mechanism. I started with the simplest 2-dimensional one, to truly understand how to create a wirebender. This mechanism would receive a wire fed from the wirefeeding mechanism, which would then bend the wire at given points, depending on the parameters specified in the code that would supplement the hardware. Thorough documentation of the manufacturing process can (again) be found in the class 10 page linked above, but I still have a demonstration of the results below.
            </p>

            <div class="subsubsubsection">
              <h5>the results</h5>
              <p>
                Here are the results produced with this wirebending mechanism. This goes hand-in-hand with the wirefeeding mechanism, and I can now successfully code it to work remotely and bend whatever shapes I like, so long as they are 2-dimensional.
              </p>

              <hr>
              <p>
                With this complete, the wirebending part of this system was complete, and they could be put together and coded to work.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p>
              This mechanism could now be put together with the rest of the system to produce the full wirebending system.
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>
            With that work out of the way, the class 10 assignment, otherwise known as the 2D wirebending system, was complete. This now allowed me to bend wire into any 2-dimensional shape I liked. I needed now to take this one step further, so that I could create 3-dimensional shapes.

          <p>
            The last bit that remained for this project was to upgrade this system to move in a 3rd dimension. This would be the final step, and as soon as I figured out how to do this, I would be able to proceed with building and completing this project. This involves a third stepper motor that would be able to move the 2D wirebending part in order to add another dimension of motion. Below, I have my plans for creating that 3rd dimension.

        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>
          With these plans complete, I would be able to transition into building, coding, and executing this final project idea. The planning was the most vital and crucial step, because as long as I understand exactly how to implement what I'm doing, I am able to implement it without that many general hiccups.

          This section will detail what I worked on with class 12, to be held on 30 July, 2020. Since the entire class is spent on prepping for the final project, I have simply included this section in this page for simplicity.

          Here, I have the results for my final project. I have images of the circuitry, the hardware that I designed/built, the software and code that I wrote, along with a video presentation of this project. Hope you enjoy!

          This has been a very fun course, and I certainly learned a lot about designing/creating hardware, coding software, and prototyping/executing creations that I have in mind. It was a very interesting exploration of practical applications of physics, and it was definitely one of my favorite hands-on experiences in a classroom/learning environment!

        <p>
          Many thanks to out to Nathan, Rob, and Victoria for being amazing teachers and helping me every step of the way, as well as all my classmates in being amazing people that have such incredible imaginations! Thanks also go out to every single resource I used when working through this course. This is definitely a course that I would recommend to anyone interested with a hands-on experience, and I am sure anyone who takes it will enjoy the laid-back but nevertheless rigorous course. While I wish I could've done it at Harvard University in person, I am still happy with what I got.
