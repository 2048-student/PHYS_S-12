        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page describes what I have learned with class 10, held on 23 July, 2020. During this class, we focused a little more on the mechanical side of things, and learned more about stepper motors and how to drive them. We also had the opportunity to think more about our final projects, and start executing some plans involving that project.

        <h2>assignment</h2>
        <p>
          For this class's assignment, we were supposed to create a computer/phone-controlled machine that incorporated at least one stepper motor. I had a lot of ideas, but I had to make it feasible and build it in the limited time I had.

          <h3>wirebender</h3>
          <p>
            My favorite idea was to create a wirebending mechanism, as the one described by Nathan during the class as an example for interesting applications of stepper motors. This endeavor proved to be a very difficult task, however, much more challenging than I had anticipated, but I worked extensively to get it to work.

            <h4>the plan</h4>
            <p>
              The plan was deceptively simple: create a wirebending mechanism by feeding/straightening a wire into a stepper motor that will then bend the wire by turning a certain number of steps with a certain cooldown period in between. This means I would need two different mechanims working together to get the wirebending machine up and running: a feeding mechanism, and a bending mechanism.

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>the feeding mechanism</h4>
            <p>
              The first part (and the most vital to get right) is the feeding mechanism. This mechanism simply needs to feed a straight piece of wire through at a constant rate into the bending mechanism. This part was the most challenging for me, as it required materials I didn't have, such as metal gears and an attaching mechanism to connect to the second stepper motor.

              <h5>planning it out</h5>
              <p>
                This took the most planning out of everything. I spent a lot of time researching the entire wirebending mechanism, specifically this wire feeding one. I researched a lot on YouTube and online to find wirebending (and wirefeeding) mechanisms that looked more or less "doable" in a short amount of time with limited materials, and found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpuprEfqoEk" target="_blank">this video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuPn93EE6UI" target="_blank">this one</a> as examples. The first one, after more research and looking at <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-3d-wire-bending-machine/" target="_blank">this page</a> on the Arduino project board, involved too many 3D printed parts, and so I eventually decided to try to replicate the simpler one in the second video. After a lot of fiddling with the kit and researching more mechanisms online, I found exactly what I needed, which is actually a bunch of parts necessary to complete the mechanism connected to a stepper motor (link on Amazon right <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RM1WL1C/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B07RM1WL1C&pd_rd_w=NeDFt&pf_rd_p=48d372c1-f7e1-4b8b-9d02-4bd86f5158c5&pd_rd_wg=Dg0lb&pf_rd_r=D6VN5VZK7JWF5E7J4DW6&pd_rd_r=0bee2706-16d3-4a0d-ace3-eb0b910e957c&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyQjg5VDkzV0hQRDlaJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDM3Mjg2MzQ2SDM4SUZIVk1MNSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzg2MzU4MURLRVZBT0Y1OUJaQyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=" target="_blank">here</a> (broken link)). Below is an image of the exact mechanism that I would need to attach to the first stepper motor.

          This was an overall long week, but I was able to get a lot done, even if I didn't complete the actual build in time for class. I also celebrated my birthday on Sunday, which was also quite fun. I was excited to start finishing up the materials for this course, and wrapping everything up. Over the next few days, I would have to finalize all my assignment pages (fixing anything that didn't look right, reformatting, completing outstanding assignments, etc.) and get a good chunk of my final project done. It would be a lot of work, but I am up for the challenge.
