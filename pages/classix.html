        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page describes what I have learned with class 9, held on 21 July, 2020. This class dealt with networking and controlling boards through WiFi and other internet connection.
        </p>

        <h2>understanding wifi and internet connection</h2>
          <p>
            This class focused on understanding how internet works and how we can use it to control boards not in our vicinity through the internet. We discussed LANa and Wifi. More information can be found on <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/09_networking/overview.html" target="_blank">Nathan's page</a> linked here. There's a lot to write, and there's a lot I learned, but I believe it's best described with my assignment and the learning process for getting that to work.

        <h2>breakout rooms: controlling leds with internet</h2>
          <p>
            We worked with LEDs and controlling them through the internet. We used FireBase, which allows us to control them from anywhere in the world, even outside the local network. This culminated in configuring FireBase and even controlling these LEDs from a website which had FireBase configured for me. This website most likely doesn't work anymore (as it has probably been a while since I disconnected the circuit from my computer by the time you are viewing this page), but it can still be accessed <a href="https://2048-student.github.io/PHYS_S-12/pages/ledplay.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The JS is not mine, as it was used for demonstrative purposes. As always, more documentation on how this works and how to set it up can be found on <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/09_networking/index.html" target="_blank">Nathan's GitHub page</a>, as well as the subsequent links for Rob's pages; just remember to input your own personal data there when it comes to configuring FireBase.

        <h2>assignment</h2>
        <p>
          For the assignment, we practiced controlling a different device through the internet. I decided to replace the LED with a buzzer, to see if I could make the buzzer make a noise.
        </p>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>working with the buzzer</h3>
          <p>
            Here, I detail what I did with the buzzer, code and videos included.

            <h4>the circuit</h4>
            <p>
              For the simplest of circuits, I simply decided to replace the LED with the buzzer. However, since the pins didn't align because of the sizes, I wired it a little further. This was meant to resemble Rob's alternate wiring for the LED shown in a Slack channel, and I simply swapped out the LED for a buzzer. The circuit is visible here.

            <h4>the code</h4>
            <p>
              The code was a very simple modification on the code we used in the tutorials for the LED, found on <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/09_networking/huzzah1.html" target="_blank">Nathan's page</a>. I simply made it produce a tone instead of turning the LED on. Of course, it is important to include a definition of the <code>myTone()</code> function here, as I am using the Huzzah.

              I currently was not able to get the website configured, but I can change the status from the FireBase project page, as is visible in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/38FiPwZ0e9o" target="_blank">here</a>.

            Overall, I learned a lot about controlling things through the internet, which is pretty cool! The link for further documentation on JavaScript and another cool place where you can toggle my buzzer from your home is <a href="https://2048-student.github.io/PHYS_S-12/pages/internetfun.html" target="_blank">here</a>, though it probably long doesn't work by the time you push those buttons.
