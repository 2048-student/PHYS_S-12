      <h1>07: electronic input devices</h1>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page details what I learned with class 7, held on 14 July, 2020. This class focused a lot on sensors and other electronic input devices. These would come in handy with controlling inputs and outputs, which is something quite useful when it comes to designing the final project (especially in my case).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>the components</h2>
          <p>
            To understand the inputs and how they work, we need to first revisit the kit, and then understand applications of these devices and how they can be incorporated into circuits to yield results and outputs with those circuits.
          </p>

            <h3>revisiting the kit</h3>
            <p>
              To understand what electrical input devices are and how they work, we need to look back on the kit we got, and specifically some of the components in it. We looked specifically at anything in bag 2, titled "sensors".
            </p>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>light input</h4>
              <p>
                One very common form of inputs are those that deal with light, otherwise known as light sensors. There are visible light sensors, IR sensors, UV sensors, etc, though our kit really only has visible and IR sensors.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>sound input</h4>
              <p>
                Sound inputs are also really useful when it comes to various projects and components, and typically comes in the form of a microphone. Sensors that measure sound input can also be found in the kit, and can be used to make clap-on and clap-off lights, for example. "Hey Siri" is activated through sound input in the microphone of an iPhone.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>motion and force</h4>
              <p>
                Another very useful thing that can be measured and used as input is motion, or by extension, pressure. The kit contains a proximity sensor, as well as Velostat pressure-sensitive sheets. These can measure changes in pressure or distance, which can be used to make automatically-opening doors, for example. The kit also contains an accelerometer, which measures difference in velocity and motion, which is commonly used in smartphones for health applications.
              </p>

            <div class="subsubsection">
              <h4>other</h4>
              <p>
                There are also other sensors available in the kit and outside the kit, such as temperature sensors (thermistors). Some of these are availab in thed kit, and can be used to make other sensors.

        <h2>breakout rooms: capacitive sensors</h2>
        <p>
          We worked with a capacitive sensor during the breakout room session. We installed the "CapacitiveSensors" library from Arduino, hooked up a circuit that looks like this, and measured outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          After playing around with this, we were ready for the assignment, which would involve calibration of some sensor and some measuring.

        <h2>assignment</h2>
        <p>
          For this class's assignment, we were supposed to calibrate two things: a sensor from our kit, and a sensor that we created ourselves. Both were rather annoying and difficult, but the results are quite interesting.

          <h3>calibrating sensor in the kit: Hall</h3>
          <p>
            I initially wanted to calibrate the potentiometer, but after a lot of fussing around with th circuitry, I decided instead to calibrate the Hall sensor, as Robert did in his demonstration. This would provide me with a better understanding of how to wire a sensor to calibrate, as the potentiometer's pins were confusing me more than enlightening me. I used an old bar magnet I managed to to dig up.
          </p>

          <div class="subsubsection">
            <h4>wiring the circuit</h4>
            <p>
              This took a lot of trial and error, as I wasn't sure how to wire it for it to produce a result. However, after a lot of fiddling around, I figured out a way to wire it so that I could then, with some code in Arduino, measure maximum and minimum inputs.

            <h4>the results</h4>
            <p>Here, I have my results for the calibration.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> Here is the code I inputted into the Arduino for calibration:</p>
            <div class="code">
              <pre>
                <code class="language-arduino">
                  void setup(){
                     Serial.begin(9600);
                   }
                   void loop(){
                     int val = analogRead(A0);  // read Hall sensor value
                     Serial.println(val);
                     delay(25);
                   }
                </code>
              </pre>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p>Here is the graph that I came up with whilst calibrating the circuit:</p>

            <h4>the conclusion</h4>
            <p></p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>Now that I had successfully calibrated the Hall sensor, I was ready to fabricate my own sensor and calibrate it.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>calibrating self-fabricated sensor: proximity</h3>
          <p>
            After looking through some cool sensors online, I decided to replicate one cool sensor that I found online, which utilized proximity. I wanted to control the intensity of an LED with the proximity from some copper tape. I wired up the circuit and recorded my results.
