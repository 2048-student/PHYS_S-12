			<h2>introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This is a super-secret page which contains some fun I had with controlling the LED wired into my circuit with the internet! This was demo code provided by Nathan on his page for us to better understand FireBase and how to control things from our websites and in general how to control things remotely. The CSS is mine, but the JS is his. It was still fun to play with it though!
			</p>

			<h2>the led fun</h2>
			<p>
				Here you can have some fun with turning an LED wired into a circuit on and off. As a disclaimer: this function probably no longer works, as it has probably been a long time since I disconnected this circuit from my board when you are looking at this. It was still fun while it lasted!
			</p>
			<div class="subsection">
				<h3>the fun</h3>
				<p>
					There's been enough chattering here. The buttons are enclosed in the following subsection. Again, they most likely no longer work, but they did work in the test runs, which is what was most important.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<div class="subsubsection">
					<h4>buttons</h4>
					<p>
						Here, you can click one button to make a green LED wired to my circuit turn on, and the other one to make that same LED turn off.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<button class="button" id="turn-on" name="turnon">Turn On </button>
					<button class="button" id="turn-off" name="turnoff">Turn Off </button>

				<p>
					This was overall a fun experiment conducted in the breakout rooms for this class, which taught me a lot about configuing FireBase and controlling things from my board remotely, which would potentially come in real handy for my final project, if I ever wanted to be able to control it remotely.
					<p>

				As a final reminder, these buttons probably don't work anymore (and you'd have no real way of seeing if they worked or not, just take my word for it), but it was still a fun experiment to run in the breakout rooms. As always, more information regarding that class can be found in the class 9 tab above, and documentation regarding how to set this all up and how all of this works can be found on <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/09_networking/index.html" target="_blank">Nathan's GitHub page</a> linked here among other places.
