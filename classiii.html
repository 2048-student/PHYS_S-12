        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This page details what I learned with class 2, held on 30 June, 2020. This is where we all got more acquainted with the tools in our kit, and where we actually started working with the tools in our kits. This would be the first true exploration of what was in our kit and how to use it, as well as a brief introduction to Arduino, a programming language that would help us program the boards we had to do what we want them to do, something extremely useful for the final project.

          <h3>the kit comes!</h3>
          <p>
            The kit had finally managed to arrive, thanks to Rob's and Nathan's perseverence in the face of uncertainty! I had technically gotten my kit the afternoon before, but I barely had enough time to even open up the kit by that point, so today it was!

          <p>
            Here, I will talk a little bit about what was in the kit, and how those components can work together to produce simple machines that can do really interesting things. With my new kit finally here, I was ready to put it to use.

            With the basics of what's in the kit sorted out, we were ready to start putting things together and wiring some basic circuits in the breakout rooms.

          During the breakout rooms for this class, we focused mainly on getting better acquainted with the items in our kit, as well as beginning to put them together into very basic circuits that could simply provide some form of output.
